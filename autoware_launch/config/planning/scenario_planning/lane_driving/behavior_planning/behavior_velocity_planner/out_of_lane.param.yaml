  ros__parameters:
    out_of_lane:  # module to stop or slowdown before overlapping another lane with other objects
      mode: threshold  # mode used to consider a conflict with an object. "threshold", "intervals", or "ttc"
      threshold:
        time_threshold: 5.0  # [m/s] consider objects that will reach an overlap within this time
      intervals:  # consider objects if their estimated time interval spent on the overlap intersect the estimated time interval of ego
        ego_time_buffer: 0.5 # [s] extend the ego time interval by this buffer
        objects_time_buffer: 0.5 # [s] extend the time intervals of objects by this buffer
      ttc:
        threshold: 2.0 # [s] consider objects with an estimated time to collision bellow this value while on the overlap

      objects:
        minimum_velocity: 0.5  # [m/s] objects lower than this velocity will be ignored

      overlap:
        minimum_distance: 0.0  # [m] minimum distance inside a lanelet for an overlap to be considered
        extra_length: 0.0  # [m] extra arc length to add to the front and back of an overlap

      action:  # action to insert in the path if an object causes a conflict at an overlap
        maximum_deceleration: 2.0  # [m/sÂ²] maximum deceleration that can be caused by the action
        distance_buffer: 0.0  # [m] buffer distance to keep between the ego footprint and lane
        slowdown:
          distance_threshold: 50.0 # [m] insert a slowdown when closer than this distance from an overlap
          velocity: 2.0  # [m/s] slowdown velocity
        stop:
          distance_threshold: 50.0 # [m] insert a stop when closer than this distance from an overlap

      ego:
        extra_front_offset: 1.0 # [m] extra front distance
        extra_rear_offset: 0.0 # [m] extra rear distance
        extra_right_offset: 0.0 # [m] extra right distance
        extra_left_offset: 0.0 # [m] extra left distance
